# Pixel
Pixel is a Mini Game writen in C between 2010 and 2011, during my studies. 
There is a .exe if you want to try it.

Config
------
Myconio.h are custom conio.h files. They need to be included for the build to work. 

Modern Windows Console do not diplay the game properly, try using older version in setting and also resize the window for a better game experience.
